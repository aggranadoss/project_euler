# Explanation of the code and algorithm.

### Angel Granados 

The solution has three functions, one of the minimum common multiplier (MCM) to find for any two positive integers, another of the maximum value (MAXVALUE), that is, given a value N (In the case of the exercise $N = 1000$) it finds all the multipliers of m1 (multipliers one) and m2 (multipliers two) in the case of the exercise it would be 3 and 5, until reaching N or less than N. The last function (SUMVALUE) makes the sum of the multipliers m1 and m2 and also makes the sum of the minimum common multiplier in order that if $N>MCM(m1,m2)$ then subtract from the sum, due to the repetition of the added values.
