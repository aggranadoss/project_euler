# EVEN FIBONACCI NUMBERS
## Angel Granados

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution:

The algorithm is designed in a simple way, the limit is evaluated when the Fibonacci sum does not exceed 4 million, and when the sum module is even, it performs a new sum only of the pairs. Whose total is 4613732. The program is executed in Linux on Debian systems in the C language.
